# Growlo

Native app design for android and iOS users. 
The main idea of the app is to put up an offer to give away for free or for a small fee the surplus food of your own harvest (crops) 
e.g. apples from the tree, natural milk from the cow, potatoes from the field. 
That is, anything your garden has produced in excess and you don't need it.
